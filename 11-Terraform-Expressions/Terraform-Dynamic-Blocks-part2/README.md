A dynamic block is used to generate multiple blocks of a particular resource or module that would otherwise need to be manually duplicated. This is particularly useful when you want to create resources or sub-blocks conditionally or dynamically, based on a list, map, or any iterable structure.

A dynamic block essentially allows you to loop over data structures and generate blocks of code based on the elements in those structures, offering more flexibility and reducing redundancy in your code.

### Use Cases for Dynamic Blocks
Creating multiple sub-resources: When you need to define multiple sub-blocks (e.g., ingress rules in a security group, or multiple disks for an instance) but don't want to duplicate code.

Conditional resource creation: You can dynamically control whether certain blocks are created by filtering the data in for_each or using conditional logic.

Simplify and reduce redundancy: Instead of writing multiple similar blocks manually, dynamic blocks can help you iterate over data and generate the needed blocks.

```t
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  dynamic "tags" {
    for_each = var.instance_tags
    content {
      key   = tags.key
      value = tags.value
    }
  }
}
```

Why We Use ingress.value.xxx:
for_each creates a loop: When you use for_each = local.ingress_rules (or any list/map), Terraform loops through each item in that iterable (in this case, local.ingress_rules).

Accessing the current item: During each iteration, Terraform stores the current element of the list in a variable. The variable name is determined by the block name. In your example, the dynamic block is named ingress, so the current item in the loop can be accessed using ingress.value.

Accessing fields in the object: Since local.ingress_rules is a list of objects (each object containing fields like from_port, to_port, etc.), you need to use ingress.value.xxx to access individual fields (xxx being the field name like from_port, protocol, etc.)

### Note: 
Where Will the Security Group Be Created?
By default, if no vpc_id is specified in the aws_security_group resource, Terraform will create the security group in the default VPC of the specified region (us-east-1 in this case).
Specifying a VPC
If you want the security group to be created in a specific VPC (other than the default one), you'll need to specify the VPC ID explicitly using the vpc_id argument.

# Specify VPC ID (either fetch it dynamically or hard-code it)
```t
data "aws_vpc" "selected" {
  default = true  # You can set this to false and filter by tags or IDs to select a specific VPC
}
```
```t
# Specify the VPC in which this security group should be created
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.selected.id
```
Key Changes:
vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.selected.id: This line ensures that the security group is created inside the VPC that you specify. In this case, we're fetching the default VPC using the data "aws_vpc" block. If you want to create the security group in a specific VPC (not the default one), you can filter by VPC tags or provide a specific VPC ID.

data "aws_vpc" block: This block dynamically retrieves the VPC ID. In this example, we are fetching the default VPC by setting default = true. You can modify this to point to a specific VPC by applying different filters (such as by name, tag, or ID).
